        <h2 class="subsection">Steps:</h2>

        <ol class="list">
            <li>In a large bowl with water, soak beans overnight.</li>

            <li>When you are ready to make your stew, in a large heavy-bottom soup pot, 
                over medium heat, add the oil and bacon. 
                Cook until crisp and transfer to a plate.
            </li>

            <li>Use the same saucepan to brown ribs and sausages in batches. 
                Set each aside as cooked.
            </li>

            <li>If needed, add more oil to the pan. On medium-high, saut√© onion, 
                and garlic until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. 
                Add tomatoes and cook for another 3 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>Drain and rinse the soaked beans. Add them to the pot along with the ribs, 
                bacon, sausages, salt, pepper, and bay leaf. Cover with water (about 8 cups).
            </li>

            <li>Bring the mixture to a boil and reduce the heat to low. 
                Cover and let it cook for 2 to 2 and a half hours, or until the beans are soft.
            </li>

            <li>If the stew is too liquidy, uncover the saucepan and 
                continue to cook for another 20 minutes to allow some of the liquid to evaporate.
            </li>

            <li>Serve with white rice and sprinkle some farofa on top.</li>
        </ol>
